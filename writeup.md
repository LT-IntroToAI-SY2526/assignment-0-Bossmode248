## Reading Comprehension Questions
All answers can be found in the README.md file

**1. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?**

[Git hub is the place where people can store their projects that they made on git, and where they can distribute it to others. So you basically do mostly all the work on git, and publish it with a good description on github for people to explore and use.]

**2. Explain what "committing and pushing" means in your own words. Why are these steps important?**

[commiting is saving the changes you made to the specific file you edited, and pushing is sending those changes to the repository and making it actually public. They are important to make sure all changes are shown and saved and not hidden away or completely wasted.]

**3. What is a repository and what does it contain?**

[repository is where all of our projects will be stored, and where they can be public on our profile.]
